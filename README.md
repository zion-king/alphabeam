# AlphaBeam Conversational Business Intelligence
## About
AlphaBeam CBI is an avant-garde Conversational Business Intelligence solution, the first of its kind, that redefines data interaction by seamlessly helping business users to explore their data without having to rely on their tech teams every time. While traditional BI tools have empowered data exploration through dashboards and reports, they often cater to a specialized audience, requiring technical expertise and leaving out crucial stakeholders. This results in missed insights, delayed decisions, and a limited understanding of their data's true potential. 

To address this shortcoming in fostering a truly interactive and user-centric experience for non-technical users, AlphaBeam seamlessly blends conversational capabilities with advanced analytics, creating a symbiotic relationship between business users and their data.

## AlphaBeam Capabilities
At a glance, AlphaBeam offers businesses and organisations, in particular non-technical stakeholders, a data-agnostic solution to ingest data from different sources, a semantic layer which translates raw data into business vocabularies and user queries into precise metrics and visualizations, a conversational interface for ad-hoc analysis and AI-powered insights through Gemini LLM, and a visualisation layer transforms the retrieved data into compelling dashboards. 

These capabilities empower users to carry out the following:
- **Conversational Inquiries:** Business users can ask questions about already existing dashboards in natural language, just as they would converse with a colleague. They could dig deeper into the data behind the visualizations, gaining a comprehensive understanding of trends and patterns.

- **Comprehensive Metric Exploration:** Engage in a conversational dialogue to uncover insights about any metric or data point, regardless of whether it's currently displayed on the dashboard. AlphaBeam breaks users free from the constraints of pre-defined dashboards and enable them delve into any aspect of their data that piques their curiosity, regardless of their technical background.

- **Visualization on Demand:** AlphaBeam enables stakeholders to explore data interactively, receive accurate and insightful interpretations of visuals and data trends, and generate dynamic visualizations with specific data points for deeper understanding.

**- Decision Making at the Speed of Data:** By uncovering hidden trends and patterns through conversational querying, AlphaBeam empowers users to make informed decisions very quickly based on readily available and easily digestible insights.
