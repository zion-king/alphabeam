# AlphaBeam Conversational Business Intelligence
## About
AlphaBeam CBI is an avant-garde Conversational Business Intelligence solution, the first of its kind, that redefines data interaction by seamlessly helping business users to explore their data without having to rely on their tech teams every time. While traditional BI tools have empowered data exploration through dashboards and reports, they often cater to a specialized audience, requiring technical expertise and leaving out crucial stakeholders. This results in missed insights, delayed decisions, and a limited understanding of their data's true potential. To address this shortcoming in fostering a truly interactive and user-centric experience for non-technical users, AlphaBeam seamlessly blends conversational capabilities with advanced analytics, creating a symbiotic relationship between business users and their data.

At a glance, AlphaBeam offers businesses and organisations, in particular non-technical stakeholders, a data-agnostic solution to ingest data from different sources, a semantic layer which translates raw data into business vocabularies and user queries into precise metrics and visualizations, a conversational interface for ad-hoc analysis and AI-powered insights through Gemini LLM, and a visualisation layer transforms the retrieved data into compelling dashboards. 
## AlphaBeam Capabilities
